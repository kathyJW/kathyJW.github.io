      <description>Kathy Wang, kw28672 0. Introduction This project explores data from the Austin Animal Shelter from 2017-2019. The Austin Animal Center Shelter dataset was obtained by the Austin government&#39;s data portal (data.austintexas.gov), and contains the &amp;quot;outcomes of animals&amp;quot;(where they ended up) that were at the center. The date of the outcome, what the outcome was, and the name, ID, age, species, color, and sex of the animals are included. The entire dataset had 121,190 observations, but has been lessened down to 18,066 observations to only include animal outcomes from 2017-2019.</description>
